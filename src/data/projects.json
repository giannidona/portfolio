      "Project developed using nextjs and tailwindcss.",
      "This is a UI component library aimed at indie hackers. All the components included, and those that will be added, are programmed by me, drawing inspiration from various SaaS websites.",
      "The goal is to contribute to the community, allowing developers to focus more on their products without wasting time on design.",
      "This is a project I have wanted to undertake for a long time, and now that I have a better understanding of Next.js, I am making it happen. I plan to improve it over time, adding more components and possibly turning it into an npm package."
